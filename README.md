## biojs-vis-inchlib

InCHlib is an interactive JavaScript library which facilitates data visualization and exploration by means of a cluster heatmap. InCHlib is a versatile tool, and its use is not limited only to chemical or biological data. Source code, tutorial, documentation and example data are freely available from [InCHlib website](http://openscreen.cz/software/inchlib). At the website, you can also find a Python script [inchlib_clust](http://openscreen.cz/software/inchlib/inchlib_clust) which performs data clustering and prepares input data for InCHlib.
